## The tentative project title

Who Let the ’Roaches Out???

## The motivation for this project

In 2017, 15.6% of households
[reported](http://www.sternenvironmental.com/blog/2017/04/18/nyc-breaks-the-top-ten-list-for-worst-rat-and-cockroach-problems/)
having pest infestations. One of the most common pests in NYC is
cockroaches. As temperatures rise, cockroach populations are
[expected](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/its-summer-in-nyc-and-the-cockroaches-have-taken-flight)
to increase, posing additional public health challenges, particularly
among those who have asthma or respiratory reactions to cockroaches.

## The intended final products

  - Website with a descriptive landing page, information on analyses and
    data, and helpful visualizations on a flex dashboard
  - Screencast

## The anticipated data sources

  - [NYC Environment and Health Data
    Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/BuildATable.aspx)
    - “Using the Housing and Health” and “Asthma and the Environment”
    datasets
  - [NYC Community Health
    Survey](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page)
    - For other health variables

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Planned analyses and visualizations: 1. Spatial visualization of
reported household cockroach exposure across the five boroughs 2. Shiny
visualization for people to input neighborhood or demographic info and
see spread of cockroaches across NYC 3. Graphs depicting temporal
changes in factors relating to asthma and cockroaches

Challenges: 1. Learning how to use Shiny 2. Using geographic indicators
across different datasets 3. Cleaning and tidying datasets to properly
merge
