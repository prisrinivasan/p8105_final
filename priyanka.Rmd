Edits from Alice's code to:

  * recode `Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge` as `209`
  * add hospitalization variable
  * add geo_place_name variable

# Shape files
Shape files turned out better. Used a different file from nyc.gov because the Env & Health Data Portal file was inconsistent - combined certain neighborhoods that weren't combined in the rest of the datasets.

[Source of shape files](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/health-tools/maps-gis-data-files-for-download.page)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shape = st_read("./final_data/shapefiles/", quiet = TRUE)

#look at what we have
#str(shape)

#plot all polygon boundaries
#plot(shape)

#plot just geometry column
plot(st_geometry(shape))
```

Checking the `shape` tibble, it looks like the values we need are stored properly. Merging with the `tidy_asthma`
dataset below.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
merged <- merge(shape, tidy_asthma, by.x = "UHFCODE", by.y = "geo_join_id")
```


Below is a plot filtered for 2011 poverty values. 

```{r sick plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
asthma_2011 = merged %>%
  filter(time_period == "2011")

plot(asthma_2011["poverty"])
```

Same with ggplot, which marks latitudes and longitudes:

```{r}
ggplot(asthma_2011) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = poverty))
```

Tmap with overlay on real map:

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(asthma_2011) +
  tm_polygons("homes_with_cockroaches", 
              style = "quantile",
              title = "Poverty Levels in NYC Neighborhoods")
```
