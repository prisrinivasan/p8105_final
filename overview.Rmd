# Cockroach Prevalence in New York City
## Why should we care? 
In 2017, 15.6% of households [reported](http://www.sternenvironmental.com/blog/2017/04/18/nyc-breaks-the-top-ten-list-for-worst-rat-and-cockroach-problems/) having pest infestations. One of the most common pests in NYC is cockroaches. As temperatures rise, cockroach populations are [expected](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/its-summer-in-nyc-and-the-cockroaches-have-taken-flight) to increase, posing additional public health challenges, particularly among those who have asthma or respiratory reactions to cockroaches.  

Because of this, we want to take a life course perspective and look at how hospitalization rates among children ages 0-4 are affected by prevalence of cockroaches in their homes.

# Data
We built our dataset using the [NYC Gov Environmental & Health Data Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/BuildATable.aspx). The map was built with the UHF code key from [NYC Health](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/uhf42.pdf). The asthma CSV file we used is linked (here)[asthma_data.csv]. We selected all variables relating to asthma, cockroaches, and poverty through string detection.
