## Cockroach and Asthma Prevalence in New York City
### Why should we care? 
In 2017, 15.6% of households [reported](http://www.sternenvironmental.com/blog/2017/04/18/nyc-breaks-the-top-ten-list-for-worst-rat-and-cockroach-problems/) having pest infestations. One of the most common pests in NYC is cockroaches. As temperatures rise, cockroach populations are [expected](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/its-summer-in-nyc-and-the-cockroaches-have-taken-flight) to increase, posing additional public health challenges, particularly among those who have asthma or respiratory reactions to cockroaches.  

Because of this, we want to take a life course perspective and look at how hospitalization rates among children ages 0-4 are affected by prevalence of cockroaches in their homes.
