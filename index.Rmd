## Motivation
<br>
Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in children across the United States, currently affecting more than [6 million children](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-facts/). New York City (NYC) hosts a much higher [prevalence](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief90.pdf) of childhood asthma (13%) than the rest of the [United States (7.5%)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/asthma.htm) - with children of color and low-income neighborhoods affected disproportionately:

## Got 'Roaches? 

Sticker: 

In 2017, 15.6% of households [reported](http://www.sternenvironmental.com/blog/2017/04/18/nyc-breaks-the-top-ten-list-for-worst-rat-and-cockroach-problems/) having pest infestations. One of the most common pests in NYC is cockroaches. As temperatures rise, cockroach populations are [expected](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/its-summer-in-nyc-and-the-cockroaches-have-taken-flight) to increase, posing additional public health challenges, particularly among those who have asthma or respiratory reactions to cockroaches.
