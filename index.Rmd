## Motivation
<br>
Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in children across the United States, currently affecting more than [6 million children](https://www.aafa.org/asthma-facts/). New York City (NYC) hosts a much higher prevalence of childhood asthma [(13%)](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief90.pdf) than the rest of the United States [(7.5%)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/asthma.htm) - with children of color and low-income neighborhoods affected disproportionately:

Aside from creating a financial [burden](https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/cdc-study-puts-economic-burden-of-asthma-at-more-than-80-billion-per-year) for the US economy and families, asthma leads to student absenteeism, further perpetuating educational gaps and socioeconomic disparities. It has been estimated that [14 - 18%](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0074.htm) of missed school days are explained by asthma episodes, making asthma one of the top causes of absenteeism. 

The toll of asthma on children has drawn attention and resources towards mitigation. While root causes of asthma are still [unknown](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/asthma.page), common triggers - particularly those associated with allergies - have been isolated. Household pests, including cockroaches and mice, are one of the most [common indoor triggers](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/triggers_indoor.html). 

The analyses presented here explore the association between childhood asthma and another highly prevalent NYC phenomenon - cockroaches.  

## Data
All data used for these analyses were taken from the NYC Health Department [Environment and Health Data Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/BuildATable.aspx). Asthma and cockroach prevalence came from the ["All Available Data"](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTCsv/AllAvailableData.zip) dataset. Spatial data were taken from the NYC Health Department's [GIS Center](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/health-tools/maps-gis-data-files-for-download.page). Analyses focused on asthma prevalence in public school children aged 5 - 14. 

## Findings
Overall, a strong positive correlation was observed between asthma and cockroaches. The highest asthma rates were observed among children in the Bronx. The highest proportion of homes with cockroaches was also observed in the Bronx. Potential confounding by XX was explored and found to...

## Got 'Roaches? 
If you find yourself sharing space with cockroaches, the best thing you can do is to make your home as unappealing to them as possible. We recommend using humane and sustainable methods.

## Do we want to keep this? 
In 2017, 15.6% of households [reported](http://www.sternenvironmental.com/blog/2017/04/18/nyc-breaks-the-top-ten-list-for-worst-rat-and-cockroach-problems/) having pest infestations. One of the most common pests in NYC is cockroaches. As temperatures rise, cockroach populations are [expected](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/its-summer-in-nyc-and-the-cockroaches-have-taken-flight) to increase, posing additional public health challenges, particularly among those who have asthma or respiratory reactions to cockroaches.
