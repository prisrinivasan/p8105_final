Through these analyses we hope to identify and analyze risk factors for childhood asthma and 

# Data

We built our dataset using the [NYC Gov Environmental & Health Data Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/BuildATable.aspx). The map was built with the UHF code key from [NYC Health](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/uhf42.pdf). The asthma CSV file we used is linked (here)[asthma_data.csv].
